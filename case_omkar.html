                        <p class="content">SDG 7, which emphasizes affordable and clean energy, is inherently connected
                            to the renewable energy initiatives planned for Vatsalya Nagar. With ₹25,000 crore allocated
                            for renewable energy infrastructure, the city can establish solar farms, wind turbines, and
                            community solar projects to provide sustainable and reliable energy for its residents and
                            industries. Rooftop solar panels on residential and commercial buildings, supported by
                            subsidies, can ensure energy affordability for low- and middle-income groups. Additionally,
                            smart grid systems will optimize energy distribution, reducing losses and improving
                            reliability. By promoting electric vehicles powered by clean energy, Vatsalya aligns its
                            transportation and energy goals, ensuring sustainable urban mobility. These renewable energy
                            solutions not only advance SDG 7 by making clean energy accessible but also contribute to
                            the city's vision of sustainability and innovation, creating a model for eco-friendly urban
                            development.</p>

                            electric buses, bike-sharing systems, and pedestrian-friendly pathways, the city
                            significantly reduces air pollution caused by conventional vehicles, leading to better
                            respiratory and cardiovascular health for residents. Encouraging walking and cycling as part
                            of daily commutes promotes physical fitness and mental well-being. Additionally, safer and
                            greener transportation infrastructure reduces traffic-related accidents and fosters a
                            healthier urban environment. Through these initiatives, Vatsalya directly enhances the
                            health and well-being of its citizens while contributing to a more sustainable and livable
                            city.</p>
